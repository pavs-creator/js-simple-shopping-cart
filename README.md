# Simple Vanilla JavaScript Shopping Cart

This project demonstrates a basic front-end online shopping application implemented entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** (no external frameworks or libraries). It serves as an excellent example of DOM manipulation and fundamental JavaScript array methods in a practical context.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Product Listing:** Displays a fixed list of available products with their names and prices.
* **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to their shopping cart.
* **Remove from Cart:** Items can be removed from the cart.
* **Real-time Total:** Calculates and displays the running total price of items in the cart.
* **Clear Cart:** A button to empty the entire cart.
* **Sort by Price:** Sorts the items currently in the cart by price (ascending).
* **User Feedback:** Provides temporary, contextual feedback messages (e.g., "Item added," "Cart cleared").

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Basic styling and layout using Flexbox)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** (Core logic, DOM manipulation, array methods like `find`, `some`, `reduce`, and `sort`)
